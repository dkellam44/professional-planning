# Manifold Navigator — Quick Usage Guide (For Non‑Technical Users)

## 1. What is the Manifold Navigator?

The **Manifold Navigator** is a thinking partner for messy, complex questions.

Instead of asking you for perfectly formed goals or plans, it:
- Takes in your **brainstorms, rants, notes, and half‑baked ideas**.
- Figures out the **main themes and tensions** underneath.
- Shows you **how your situation looks at different levels**:
  - your personal context,
  - the organizations or systems you’re in,
  - and sometimes the larger world (markets, institutions, technology).
- Gives you a **clear summary** and a few **realistic next moves**.

Think of it as an extra‑honest friend who’s good at patterns and structure.

## 2. When should you use it?

Use the Manifold Navigator when:

- Your thoughts feel **crowded or tangled**, and you don’t know how to prioritize.
- You’re facing a **big decision** and keep cycling through the same worries.
- You want to understand your situation in the context of **larger systems**  
  (e.g., “my job” ↔ “the industry” ↔ “the economy / AI / institutions”).
- You’re starting a **new project, career direction, or learning path** and want to map it before committing.
- You feel like you’re **capable of more**, but don’t see the landscape clearly.

You *don’t* need to be technical. You just have to be willing to be honest and a bit detailed.

## 3. How to talk to it

You can keep it very simple. A typical message looks like:

```text
Use full scope but keep things understandable for a non‑technical person.

<brainstorm>
I’m trying to decide what to focus on for the next few years.
Part of me wants to double down on my current work.
Another part of me feels pulled toward AI / automation,
but I don’t know how that fits my skills or the wider world.
I feel underqualified and late to the game.
</brainstorm>
```

A few tips:

- **Use tags** like `<brainstorm> ... </brainstorm>` if you’re pasting a long mess of thoughts.
- Don’t worry about structure or grammar inside the brainstorm — **just dump it**.
- If you care about tone, say so:
  - “Be very direct; don’t sugarcoat.”
  - “Be gentle; I’m feeling overwhelmed.”

## 4. What you’ll get back

The Navigator’s reply is usually structured into sections, for example:

1. **Latent Dimensions Map**  
   - A list of the main “axes” in what you said.  
     (e.g., Security ↔ Growth, Local impact ↔ Global impact.)

2. **Scale & Horizon Map**  
   - How your concerns show up at different levels:
     - your day‑to‑day life,
     - your organization,
     - your industry or the wider world.

3. **Assumptions & Gaps**  
   - What you seem to be assuming.
   - What’s unclear or missing.
   - Where you might be under‑ or over‑estimating yourself or the environment.

4. **Manifold Narrative**  
   - A short story explaining what you’re really circling around.

5. **Reduced Essence**  
   - One or a few sentences that capture the heart of it.

6. **Action Vectors**  
   - A small menu of **possible paths or moves**, usually at:
     - **Micro level** (things you can do today or this week),
     - **Meso level** (projects over months),
     - **Macro level** (longer‑term directions).

7. **Metrics & Reflection**  
   - Suggestions for how to tell if you’re making progress,
   - And a few prompts for what to ask next.

You can skim the whole thing, or just jump to the parts that feel most helpful.

## 5. How to get the most value from it

A few simple practices:

1. **Be specific in your mess.**  
   Vague: “Work is stressful.”  
   Better: “My boss keeps changing priorities, I’m worried about money, and I feel like I’m falling behind on learning new tools.”

2. **Tell it what kind of help you want today.**  
   - “I want clarity, not comfort.”  
   - “Please focus on small, practical next steps.”  
   - “I want to see how this fits in the bigger picture.”

3. **Use it as a recurring mirror.**  
   Come back with updates:
   - “Since last time, I tried Action A, here’s what happened…”  
   This lets the Navigator refine its map over time.

4. **Don’t treat it as an oracle.**  
   It’s a powerful pattern‑finder, not a fortune‑teller.  
   Use its output to:
   - notice new angles,
   - name your assumptions,
   - choose experiments,
   - and make your own decisions.

## 6. Example “starter prompts”

You can copy/paste and fill these in:

**Life / direction:**

```text
Use full scope but keep math and jargon light.

<brainstorm>
Here’s what my life looks like right now…
[describe work, energy levels, money, relationships, hopes, fears]

Here are the decisions or questions that feel most alive…
[list big ones]

Here’s what I’ve tried already…
[brief history]
</brainstorm>
```

**Work / project:**

```text
Focus on my work and the systems around it.

<brainstorm>
I’m working on / thinking about:
[project, job, or business]

Here’s what feels stuck or confusing:
[...]

Here’s what I think I want long‑term:
[...]
</brainstorm>
```

**Learning / skills:**

```text
Help me map my learning and skill path.

<brainstorm>
These are the skills I currently have:
[...]

These are the skills or domains I’m drawn to:
[...]

These are my constraints (time, money, energy):
[...]
</brainstorm>
```

## 7. What this is *not*

- It’s not a replacement for **therapy, legal, medical, or financial advice**.
- It won’t make decisions *for* you.
- It’s not trying to keep you “comfortable” — it’s trying to keep you **aligned with reality** while still respecting your humanity.

Used well, the Manifold Navigator can help you see your situation — and your options — with more structure, honesty, and range than you can usually access alone.
