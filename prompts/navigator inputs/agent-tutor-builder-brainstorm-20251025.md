I want to build a hybrid learning and building advisor assistant in claude code.
My goals are to use an integrated workflow with an agent that both teaches me (the user), advises me and builds with me and for me as I build and grow my knowledge, capabilities, competencies broadly in computer science, especially designing building and deploying production grade ai agents. This should support, drive and grow the initiatives I currently have articulated as the Ops Studio Venture in my Founder HQ framework. That is I should progressively build, learn, deploy, monetize, expand capabilities as I go. This should be scaled to my knowlege level but should push capabilites knowing that I have an ai assistant and ai employees with top-class capabilities on hand at all times. In other words, even if a given project or initiative exceeds my personal abilities or understanding, the AI can take the lead with the initiative and develop plans to "catch me up" in my knowlege with a learning plan. As I am building, I will want a way to ask clarifying questions and have the ai assistant give me a brief answer, note the area of ontology, update context, develop a 'topic deep dive' and/or update my on-going learning ciriculum/roadmap, and schedule lessons in my lesson plan. It should be like it is dynamically creating the perfect textbook pages just when the user needs the lesson. I will need to be specific in the design of this co-pilot, tutor, business mentor, agent worker (or should these be individual agents working in orchestration?). What tools and capabilities are available in the claude code ecosystem? This is also something that is core to my personal learning. I should base lessons on things like the Anthropic docs for working with API's, Claude Code and its constituent patterns like hooks, skills, subagents, slash commands, MCP servers, API, and more I am forgetting. I will have to learn infrastructure like what I am working on with cloudflare, docker compose, tunnels, protocols and so on. The agent will have to have a way to assess my current state of understanding and expose the prerequisites needed and a learning path and scheduled activities to build my learning while also progressing the active project in the appropriate time frame. For example, I may need the agent to complete a new project quickly for a client and schedule either retrospective time so I can learn how the project was completed, how to eval for myself, expose what ontological disciplines were involved, update my learning roadmap, schedule spaced-repetition and perioditized reinforcement learning activites, readings, quizes, first class documentation and SOP updates. All of this will requrire clever continual learning loops and context update loops, and version controlling. We should be able to visually map all the processes and meta-processes involved in this type of work. With an elegant system design of learning, observing, acting, generating revenue, all of this should be compounding and spur regenerative growth for me. This should also integrate into the meta-systems I am trying to incorporate in my repo context updating workflow, the manifold navigator observer/actor design, my founder hq workstation. What is my source of truth for all these connected patterns? Can they be designed to feed eachother? What level of clarity can I provide or develop with GenAI to implement this type of meta system and operational real-world action system. What systems already exist in the world for me to emmulate? Could I draw this in Excallidraw? could I download roadmap modules from roadmpap.sh and dynamically update them on my given context state? My goal is to become this type of new paradigm systems integrator. Build agentic automations now with n8n training wheels at my current level (eventually agentic libraries and frameworks), establish my broad computing knowledge by completing CS50x, CS50p, CS50(web), CS50(ai) grow as a solopreneur, become employable in the new AI job market revolution (maybe on the infrastructure side-- an AI plumber,  or delve into the heady meta-cognative systems and learn from the frontier machine learning scientists, or stay with my marketing background and move toward product. I'm very late in my learning and need to establish financial stability from basically zero. But it's possible and I have a vision). What other learning roadmaps to consider, MIT Econ, Compsci, Data Sci hybrid degree map?, Berkeley? Anthropic docs, Google Guides to Agents, OpenAI academy? DeepLearning courses? Remember, I think building this meta-learn-as-you-build-and-monetize with dyanmic 'text books' and 'on-demand notes' is a better idea than rigid, bloated and expensive college institutional linear curriculums. Will need a way to research and synthesize and process the best available resources and absorb and leverage them in real time. I will need to run counterfactuals to all this. I will need to examine risk. I will need to quantify the plan monetarilly, set SMART goals. Build a new Enterprise for myself. I will need to communicate with clarity and clear intent to get the most out of gen ai assistance. I will achieve what is nominally beyond me. I will build compounding revenue and financial comfort and stability. I will build compounding assets and use them with soulfull clarity. Use my growing leverage to support human connections and flourishing. Update my working plans as Founder HQ to incorporate these initiatives
