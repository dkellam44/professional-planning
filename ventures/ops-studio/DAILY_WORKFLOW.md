# Operations Studio — Daily Workflow (Pre-Revenue)

**For:** Solo operator learning programming + building first clients

---

## Morning (10 min)

1. Check `/agents/CURRENT_FOCUS.md` - What's the priority?
2. Open BestViable ERP (Coda) - Any prospect responses?
3. Set focus: Offers → Outreach → Pipeline

---

## During Work (2-4 hours)

**No current clients:**

**Option A: Define First Offer**
- Create `/ventures/ops-studio/offers/[offer-name]/offer_brief.md`
- Define: scope, price, positioning
- Can't sell without clear offer

**Option B: Build Pipeline**
- Add prospects to `/ventures/ops-studio/pipeline/outreach_tracker.md`
- Draft outreach messages
- Track conversations in Coda

**Option C: Learn from KD Close**
- Review archive: `/ventures/ops-studio/archive/kd-2024-closed/`
- Document what worked/didn't
- Refine pitch approach

---

## End of Day (10 min)

1. Commit work: `git add ventures/ops-studio/ && git commit -m "..."`
2. Update Coda pipeline (any new conversations?)
3. Git push: `git push origin main`

---

## Decision Tree

```
Have clear offer?
├─ NO → Work on offer definition
└─ YES → Have 5+ prospects?
    ├─ NO → Identify & reach out to prospects
    └─ YES → Refine pitch, follow up
```

## When Stuck

1. Read `/agents/CURRENT_FOCUS.md`
2. Check latest session handoff
3. Ask: "What's stopping the first sale?"
