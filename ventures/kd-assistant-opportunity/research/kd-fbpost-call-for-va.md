{Seeking Assistance}
 
Hey friends, 
As I transition into the next evolution of my work, I'm looking to hire someone special to help me keep my temple (and calendar) organized, something between an author’s assistant and an office manager. Ideally, someone who resonates with spirituality, sexuality, and the queer community.
Recently, I’ve had luck hiring from within my own community,  who already understand the heart of my work. So I’m putting this out here in case it’s you… or someone you know.
It’s a mix of scheduling, admin, social media, helping me keep projects flowing, and showing up twice a week for check-ins to keep my writing/publishing on track. Basically, I want help balancing my home temple with my service to the world.
If this sparks your interest, please reach out at tantrikakalidas@gmail.com
Thanks 💜
