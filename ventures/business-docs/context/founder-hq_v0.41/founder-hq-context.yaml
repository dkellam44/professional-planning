# Mirror of current v0.41 context (pointer file)
# For now, this references the canonical text content you already maintain.
# If desired, migrate the full content from founder-hq-v041-context.txt into YAML later.

source_of_truth: "founder-hq-v041-context.txt"
notes: |
  Use this file as a stable pointer for agents expecting YAML.
  When ready, map tables/enums to strict YAML schema for machine parsing.
