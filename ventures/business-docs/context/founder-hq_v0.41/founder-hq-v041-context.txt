# Founder HQ v0.4 - GenAI Machine-Readable Context
# For use with ChatGPT, Claude, or other LLM systems
# Date: September 2025

system:
  name: "Founder HQ"
  version: "0.4.0"
  platform: "Coda"
  type: "Personal ERP for Service Business"
  purpose: "Memory-first operational system for solopreneur automation agency with scalable service delivery"
  
 # Clarification: Internal System vs. Client Offers

**Founder HQ (formerly called Enterprise OS):**  
This is my **internal operating system**, built in Coda, to run and manage my own solopreneur business.  
- Purpose: daily execution, sprint planning, deal tracking, decision journal, learning, and financial health.  
- Status: strictly internal. Not sold to clients.  
- Naming: Renamed from “Enterprise OS” to “Founder HQ” in October 2025 to avoid confusion with client-facing offers.

**Client Offers:**  
Founder HQ is not an offer. My **Operations Studio** venture will define and validate specific client-facing services (automation, marketing ops, workflow design, etc.).  
- These offers are still being discovered and clarified.  
- In the future, I may develop simplified “OS-like” tools for clients (likely Notion-based), but these will be distinct from Founder HQ.  
- Branding: the broader brand architecture (whether Founder HQ, Digital Case Worker, and Operations Studio live under one umbrella brand or not) will be clarified later.

**Decision Reference:**  
See Decision Journal Entry `2025-10-02_ops-studio_naming_v01` for related notes on brand/naming strategy.
