## Visual/Layout Issues

### Title Slide
- [ ] Image sizing/positioning:
- [x] Quote placement: quote should be under blurb
- [x] Footer visibility: footer not visible
- [x] Blurb styling: blurb text "an invitation..." should not be blockquote the actual quote "Talking about...." should be in a block quote and below the blurb text. Maybe Blurb can be treated as "body text" (check for consistancy accross classes)
- [x] Overall balance: Text appears at very similar font sizes. Introduce variation. This title needs a lot of design work in the next phase (known issue). Too much empty space on right(we can address in design phase) in desktop view. 

### Alignment Slide
- [x] Quote styling: Quote does not appear
- [ ] Body text flow:
- [ ] Spacing issues:
- [x] Other notes: "Devotion Meets Discipline" is not bolded. Renders as "**XXXX**"
        In design prototypes, lets consider changing "Devotion Meets Discipline" to a separate line as an H2(or H3) header that can be stylized for impact

### Help Slide (Table)
- [x] Table readability: table not readable on mobile, Can this be horizonatally scrollable?
- [ ] Column widths:
- [ ] Blurb placement:
- [ ] Other notes:

### Regenerative Slide (Metrics)
- [x] Metrics styling (pills/badges): cannot see pills/badges
- [ ] Visual (three rings):
- [ ] Spacing/hierarchy:
- [ ] Other notes:

### Fit Slide (3-column)
- [ ] Column balance:
- [ ] Portrait size/placement:
- [ ] Testimonial styling:
- [ ] Profile link visibility:
- [x] Other notes: Bold the title of each bullet. example: **Spirit-literate operations partner**

### Engagement Slide (Pricing)
- [ ] Card styling/depth:
- [ ] Description readability:
- [ ] Pricing prominence:
- [ ] Note visibility:
- [ ] Other notes:

### CTA Slide
- [ ] Button styling:
- [x] Quote placement: quote not visible. Kali Das callout ("I hold deep respect...") can be removed and replaced with the quote
- [x] Body text flow: Body text is too long.  
- [ ] Overall impact:
- [ ] Other notes:

## Content Adjustments

### Copy Changes Needed
**Slide:** CTA
**Current text:**
I'd love to explore how we might reclaim 4–6 hours of your creative time each week. Whether that starts with calendar/inbox protocols, publishing rhythm, or bi-weekly strategy meetings with clear follow-through — we'll find the approach that serves your energy and vision. This transition moment — honoring what Kali Das built while stepping into your next evolution — is an ideal time to establish rhythms that reflect your unique vision.

more domain accurate phrasing

**Current text:**

## Design/Styling Notes

### Typography
- [x] Heading sizes feel right? - Headers can be larger
- [ ] Body text readability?
- [x] Quote styling distinct enough? - Can make more distinct
- [x] Font weights/hierarchy clear? - Not bad but could be distinguished

**Notes:**



### Colors
- [ ] Plum prominence appropriate?
- [ ] Gold accents working?
- [x] Contrast sufficient? No 
- [ ] Lavender/sage balance? 

**Notes:**



### Spacing
- [ ] Slides feel spacious?
- [ ] Any cramped areas?
- [ ] Breathing room consistent?

**Notes:**

spacing is approaching being cramped but still acceptable

### Overall Visual Impact
- [ ] Professional enough?
- [x] Too plain/boring?
- [ ] Too busy/cluttered?
- [ ] Emotional resonance?

**Notes:**
Its a bit text heavy but acceptable. Needs more contrast in color and type (size, style)

(If you checked mobile view)

- [ ] Title slide on mobile:

## Design Prototype Priorities

Based on what I saw, which slides need design exploration most?

- [x] Title slide - **Prototype A (full-bleed)** and/or **Prototype B (split-screen)**?
- [x] Alignment slide - needs visual interest? Yes but quote must be visible first
- [ ] Regenerative slide - metrics styling priority?
- [ ] Fit slide - testimonial needs more prominence?
- [ ] Engagement slide - cards need depth/shadows?
- [ ] CTA slide - buttons need more impact?

**Notes on design direction:**

Lets get things functional and readable first and then explore design variations

---

## Overall Impression

**What's working well:**
Readablility 


**What feels off/weak:**

The text needs more variation and impact

**Biggest gap vs. vision:**

Need a more modern glossy design. This can be explored more in the design phase

**Energy/tone check:**
- [x] Too formal/corporate
- [ ] Too casual/unprofessional
- [ ] Just right - warm + professional
- [ ] Other:

## Ship Decision

**After these adjustments, am I ready to share with KD?**
- [ ] Yes - just need the fixes above
- [x] Almost - need design prototypes first
- [ ] Not yet - significant work needed
- [ ] Unsure - let's discuss

**Target ship date:** 15 OCT 2025

## Additional Notes


I'll want to explore more contemporary bold and creative design in the design phase. The tile slide will need a lot of work (known issue). That will inform the type, and color/contrast decisions in the rest of the slides
