# Slide Blurbs - Draft Workspace

Use this file to draft, review, and refine blurb text before copying to JSON files.

**Guidelines:**
- Keep tone warm + professional (not corporate, not too casual)
- Use KD's vocabulary: spaciousness, tending, regenerative, creative energy
- Be specific (concrete outcomes vs vague promises)
- Show understanding of sacred/creative work
- Each blurb: 1-3 sentences max
