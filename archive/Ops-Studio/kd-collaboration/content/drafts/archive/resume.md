## Implementation Notes

**When ready to use:**

1. **Choose format:**
   - Traditional chronological (safest for most)
   - Skills-based (if career path is non-linear)
   - Hybrid (best of both)

2. **Customize for KD:**
   - Emphasize relevant experience (creative/spiritual clients)
   - Highlight community awareness (ISTA, SPC, etc.)
   - Show systems thinking (not just task execution)

3. **Decide on hosting:**
   - PDF on Google Drive (easy to share, professional)
   - MDX in appendix (keeps everything in one place)
   - Both (link to Drive from appendix)

4. **Format considerations:**
   - Keep to 1-2 pages
   - Use clear section headers
   - Bullet points for scannability
   - Professional but not corporate

5. **Link from deck:**
   - Add "Download Resume" link on CTA slide
   - Or "View Credentials" link on Fit slide
   - Use `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`
