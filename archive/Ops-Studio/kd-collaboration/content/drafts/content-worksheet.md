Questions: Drop the blurb? What might this area accomplish?
   Should we use a larger or fullsize image with text overlays?
   Anything else we can do for better style? Looks bland?
   Experiment with type options and layout

## 2. Alignment & Intention (TextSlide)

### Purpose
Establish values alignment and emotional connection. Articulate the "why" behind the partnership — moving from transactional service to sacred collaboration. Positions structure as enabling creative freedom, not constraining it.

### Layout

### Current Content

**Heading:**
> Alignment & Intention

**Body:**
> Where devotion meets discipline — this partnership is a sacred meeting of purpose and practice. I believe great ideas deserve to be resourced and I love to be in service. My intent is to offer a calm, dependable structure that expands your creative freedom and protects your temple of work — so your offerings can reach the world with clarity and grace. Together, we'll cultivate a rhythm that supports your energy and amplifies your reach.

**Blurb:**
> We'll create a dependable rhythm that protects the creative temple and turns intention into practice — without rigidity.

### Notes & Revisions

Note: REMOVE BLURB (the body text meets this purpose. Add a KD quote below body text)

New Body (WIP): *Devotion Meets Discipline* -- I greatly admire those like you who offer themselves to the world and provide the desperately needed guidance back toward love and the soul. My mission is to serve that gift by standing as a calm, dependable presence that expands your creative freedom and protects your temple of work — so your offerings can reach the world with clarity and grace. My intention is not to impose, but to gently uphold — maintaining the steadiness that allows your next evolution to blossom. Together, we’ll cultivate a rhythm that supports your energy and amplifies your reach.

New Quote: (KamalaDevi quote) *"I'm gonna be as bold as to say that transparent communities are essential to the evolution of humanity as a new nonviolent social structure."*

### Notes & Revisions

New Blurb: Measurements like these act as signposts that signal our current is strong. I can keep the details quiet in the background so the creative work can breathe. We'll tune thresholds to your comfort and cadence.

Note Metrics: 
   - Remove metric #5 (Routine responses....). 
   - Metric #4 Single source of truth (Asana) updated for bi-weekly checkins

## Cross-Cutting Analysis

### Recurring Language/Voice Elements
- **"calm, dependable"** — appears in Title subtitle, Alignment blurb, Fit bullets
- **"temple/sacred"** — Title subtitle "temple of work", Alignment "sacred meeting"
- **"rhythm/cadence"** — Alignment, Regenerative blurb, Fit bullets, Help blurb
- **"evolution"** — Title subtitle, Fit blurb, CTA blurb
- **Water/flow metaphors** — Regenerative "current is strong", Measurements of Flow heading
- **Nature metaphors** — Engagement "blossom", cards use plant emojis (🌿)
- **"spaciousness"** — Title, appears throughout as core theme

### Voice Characteristics
- Poetic but grounded
- Spiritual language balanced with operational clarity
- Partnership/collaboration framing over vendor/service provider
- Structure enables freedom (not constrains)
- Reverence without performative spirituality

### Overall Tone
- Respectful, honoring legacy (especially CTA blurb re: Kali Das)
- Confident but not imposing ("not to impose, but to gently uphold")
- Both mystical and practical
- Warm professional with creative sensitivity

### Content Strategy Observations
- Blurbs add crucial emotional/philosophical context to operational details
- CTA slide's Kali Das reference is the most important trust-building content
- Metrics slide successfully bridges measurement with soulful language
- Engagement options balance flexibility with clear structure
