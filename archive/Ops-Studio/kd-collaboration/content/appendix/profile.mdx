# David Kellam — Profile (Short)

**Base:** Berkeley, CA • **Email:** dkellam44@gmail.com

I design calm, learning-oriented operations for creative and spiritual work. My approach blends project management, marketing ops, and gentle automation with community-aware care.

**Relevant Strengths**
- Calendar & communication systems that reduce cognitive load  
- Publishing cadence & content support for author/teacher workflows  
- SOPs and a single source of truth that teams actually use  
- Light automation and dashboards that show only what matters

**Lineage & Context**
Long-time participant in tantra/sex-positive communities (ISTA, SPC, Sexological Bodywork, OM) with queer-literate, trauma-aware norms. Comfortable holding confidentiality and consent-based collaboration.

**Tools**
Google Workspace, Asana, Notion, Coda, Zapier/Make/n8n, Mailchimp, GA4, Looker Studio.
