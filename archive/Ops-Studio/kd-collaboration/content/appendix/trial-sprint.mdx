# Two-Week Starter Sprint

A short container to create immediate relief and test our working rhythm.

## Week 1 — Calendar & Inbox Flow
- Confirmations ≥48h; clean reschedule protocol  
- Inbox triage and daily routine; <20 unprocessed/day  
- Meeting windows honored; decisions log started

## Week 2 — Publishing Rhythm + Shared Hub
- Weekly pre-scheduled post/newsletter  
- Single Source of Truth (Notion/Coda) with priorities and handoffs  
- Light automation where valuable (Zapier/Make/n8n)

### Investment
**$1,200–$1,500** fixed. If we both feel the rhythm, we can transition to a monthly partnership (**$1,800–$2,800/mo**).

> *Structure as quiet assurance: enough process to free your creativity, never to constrain it.*
