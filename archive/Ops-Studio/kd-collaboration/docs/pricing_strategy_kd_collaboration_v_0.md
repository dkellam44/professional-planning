# Pricing Strategy — KD Collaboration v0.5
*Prepared by David Kellam — October 2025*

---

## 1) Positioning Frame
You are not a gig VA. You are a **fractional operations partner** for a spiritual‑creative leader. Price to signal: calm authority, learning systems, and steady outcomes.

**Primary modes (in order of preference):** Project/Sprint → Retainer → Fractional COO.  
**Fallback mode:** Hourly (only for small tests or support overflow).

---

## 2) Offer Ladder & Target Ranges
| Tier | Purpose | Scope Patterns | Target Pricing |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Diagnostic (3–5 days)** | Surface constraints, define scope, plan sprint | Interviews, systems map, 3 quick wins | **$300–$500** (creditable toward sprint if started ≤ 14 days) |
| **Starter Sprint (2 weeks)** | Immediate relief; prove rhythm & fit | Calendar + inbox protocol; shared hub; basic publishing cadence | **$1,200–$1,800** fixed |
| **Ongoing Retainer (mo.)** | Maintain rhythm; iterate/automate | 10–15 hrs/wk; ops cadence; SOPs; light automation | **$1,800–$2,800/mo** |
| **Fractional COO** | Strategic growth & process design | Launches, dashboards, vendor mgmt, quarterly roadmap | **$3,000–$5,000+/mo** (custom) |
| **Hourly** | Flexible support | Time‑boxed tasks, overflow | **$40–$55/hr** (not primary) |

**Notes:** Use simple bands (no decimals). Present outcomes, not hours; track hours privately for capacity.

## 3) Psychological Anchoring for KD (Value = Rhythm & Relief)
KD’s value lens is energetic and creative, not purely financial. Anchor investment to **Return on Energy (ROE)** and **Return on Clarity (ROC)**:

- **Creative time reclaimed:** 4–6 hrs/week (≈ 16–24 hrs/month)
- **Publishing continuity:** ≥1 pre‑scheduled post/newsletter per week
- **Inbox & calendar serenity:** <20 unprocessed items/day; 48‑hr confirmations ≥90%
- **Launch friction reduced:** fewer last‑minute fires; clearer handoffs

> *“The value isn’t how much I do; it’s how much of your creative time we free up.”*

---

## 4) Conversation Flow — Anchoring Scriptlets
**Elicit:** “What feels most constricted right now — time, organization, or creative focus?”  
**Translate:** “If we stabilize scheduling and inbox, that’s a half‑day a week back for writing.”  
**Anchor:** “Most start with a two‑week sprint (~$1.2–$1.5K) to feel immediate relief. If the rhythm lands, we move to a monthly partnership (~$2K) to keep the heartbeat steady.”  
**Elevate:** “I build systems that learn, so the value compounds as we refine what supports your flow.”

More lines:
- “When your schedule reflects your true priorities, your nervous system notices.”
- “This is an investment in *flow and freedom* — not just hours.”

---

## 5) Calibration Logic (Internal)
- **Affordability heuristic:** For retainer **R**, annual spend = 12R. Target clients with revenue/op‑budget ≥ **10–20× R**.  
- **Scope guards:** If hours > 15/wk for 2+ weeks, re‑scope or propose COO tier.  
- **Upgrade gates:** After sprint: ≥3 metrics improved (time, cadence, inbox, decisions log) → propose retainer.

---

## 6) Terms & Protections
- **Diagnostic credit:** Apply diagnostic fee to sprint if commissioned in ≤14 days.  
- **Renewal cadence:** Monthly, 30‑day opt‑out.  
- **Boundaries:** No legal/medical advice; no PHI; content approvals by KD; decision rights defined.  
- **Satisfaction guardrail:** If sprint acceptance criteria are unmet, include a make‑good block or partial credit to retainer.

---

## 7) Packaging Language (for proposals & one‑sheet)
- “Most collaborators begin with a **2‑week Starter Sprint** to feel the rhythm and experience quick relief.”  
- “If aligned, we shift to an **Ongoing Partnership** that keeps systems humming and evolves with your creative cycle.”  
- “For seasons of expansion, a **Fractional COO** role adds strategic runway, dashboards, and launch choreography.”

---

## 8) KD‑Specific Nuance — Author Support
Quietly include an author‑support option:
- Light editorial & formatting; KDP logistics; content repurposing.  
- Leverage theater/script background for narrative clarity and cadence.  
- Frame as **protecting creative time** rather than “more output.”

---

## 9) Examples of Offer Configurations
**A. Diagnostic + Sprint (preferred on‑ramp)**  
- $400 diagnostic (credited) → $1,400 sprint = **$1,800 total**

**B. Sprint‑Only (fast start)**  
- $1,500 fixed, includes acceptance criteria and make‑good clause

**C. Retainer (stability)**  
- $2,100/mo for 10–12 hrs/wk; quarterly review & scope tune

**D. COO Season (growth)**  
- $3,500/mo + scoped project blocks; launch/retreat cycles

---

## 10) One‑Line Value Summary
> **Price follows trust; trust follows empathy.** I anchor investment to reclaimed creative time, calmer comms, and a publishing rhythm that keeps KD’s presence alive without strain.
