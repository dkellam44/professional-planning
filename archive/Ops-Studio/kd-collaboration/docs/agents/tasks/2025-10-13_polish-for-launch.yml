    feat: display blurbs and remove broken NavBar

    - Add blurb rendering to all slide components (TitleCard, TextSlide, MetricsLoop, OfferCards, CTASection)
    - Style blurbs consistently with subtle distinction (text-sm, contextual placement)
    - Emphasize CTA blurb about Kali Das legacy (trust-building content)
    - Remove non-functional NavBar component
    - Delete components/NavBar.tsx

    This addresses critical gaps from code review: blurbs contain rich trust-building
    content but were hidden, and broken NavBar undermined professional positioning.

    See: docs/context/2025-10-13-polish-decisions.md

  visual_enhancements: |
    feat: redesign regenerative visual and add portrait to Fit slide

    - Replace static circle with elegant infinity loop (SVG)
    - Update labels from agricultural (Seed/Tend) to ops-relevant (Creative ↔ Operational)
    - Add gradient styling (sage → plum)
    - Render portrait on Fit slide with rounded styling and gold border
    - Polish blurb styling for consistency and emphasis (especially CTA)

    Regenerative visual now differentiates as systems thinker with sophisticated design.
    Portrait adds personal warmth and human connection.

    See: docs/context/2025-10-13-code-review.md

  content_system: |
    chore: create content drafts staging system

    - Add content/drafts/ directory
    - Create README with workflow instructions
    - Add templates: blurbs.md, profile-long.md, resume.md

    Enables safer content iteration by separating drafting (markdown) from
    implementation (validated JSON/MDX). AI and humans can collaborate more
    naturally on raw content before committing to schemas.

  appendix_expansion: |
    feat: expand appendix with profile-long and resume sections

    - Restructure app/appendix/page.tsx for three sections
    - Add profile-long.mdx for detailed background
    - Add resume.mdx placeholder
    - Add smart navigation from Fit and CTA slides
    - Support external links (Google Drive, etc)

    Provides depth for interested prospects while maintaining clean main deck.

post_completion:
  testing_checklist:
    - Run `npm run typecheck && npm run build`
    - Test on mobile (Chrome DevTools + real device)
    - Verify all blurbs display and read well
    - Check regenerative visual on various screen sizes
    - Test appendix navigation and external links
    - Verify no console errors or warnings

  preview_deployment:
    - Push to branch, verify Vercel preview URL
    - Share preview with trusted reviewer (optional)
    - Test on iPhone and Android if possible
    - Check loading speed (should feel fast)

  before_production:
    - Merge PR #2 to main
    - Monitor production deployment
    - Quick smoke test on live URL
    - Share with KamalaDevi when confident

estimated_time: "4-5 hours total (can split across 2-3 sessions)"

dependencies:
  - PR #2 TypeScript fixes (completed)
  - Code review findings (documented)
  - Polish decisions (documented)

notes:
  - Prioritize critical fixes first (blurbs + NavBar)
  - Visual enhancements can iterate based on preference
  - Content drafts system enables easier collaboration going forward
  - Some decisions still open (portrait shape, loop gradient, profile hosting)
  - Font optimization recommended but not blocking for initial share
