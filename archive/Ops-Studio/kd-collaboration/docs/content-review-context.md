## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Do Use:
- ✅ "Spaciousness" (key concept for KD)
- ✅ "Tending" (vs managing/executing)
- ✅ "Creative energy" (protect/free up)
- ✅ "Structure that breathes" (vs rigid systems)
- ✅ "Regenerative" (vs extractive)
- ✅ "Soul" (soul + systems, systems with soul)
- ✅ Specific numbers (90% confirmations, <20 inbox items)
- ✅ Metaphors from nature/cycles
- ✅ "Co-design" (collaborative vs prescriptive)

### Don't Use:
- ❌ "Hustle," "grind," "scale," "10x"
- ❌ "Maximize efficiency" (sounds extractive)
- ❌ "Execute," "deliver," "leverage" (corporate jargon)
- ❌ Generic VA language
- ❌ Overpromises or hype
- ❌ Pressure tactics
- ❌ "You need this" (instead: "What would serve you?")

### Tone Spectrum:
```
Too Corporate          Just Right              Too Woo
├──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┤
   "Maximize ROI"    "Create spaciousness"    "Align your chakras"
```

**Sweet spot:** Grounded professionalism + soul awareness

## Competitive Differentiation

### What Makes This Different from Typical VA Pitch:
- Systems thinker, not task executor
- Understands sacred/creative work
- "Spaciousness" language (not "productivity")
- Regenerative approach (not extractive)
- Soul + structure integration
