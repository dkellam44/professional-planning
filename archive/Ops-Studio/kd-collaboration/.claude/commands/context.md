You are helping update the project context documentation.

Read the current project context file at `.claude/project-context.md` and ask the user:

1. What has changed since the last update?
2. What sections need updating? (Recent Changes, Current Status, Known Issues, Next Steps, etc.)
3. Any new decisions or questions to document?

Then update the relevant sections of `.claude/project-context.md`:
- Update "Last Updated" date
- Update "Current Branch" and "Status"
- Add to "Recent Changes" section with date
- Update "Next Steps" based on what was accomplished
- Add any new known issues or technical debt
- Update "Questions & Decisions for Next Session" if needed

Maintain the existing format and structure. Be concise but thorough.
