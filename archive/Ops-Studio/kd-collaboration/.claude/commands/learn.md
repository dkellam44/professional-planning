You are helping log a learning entry to the development journal.

Read the current learning journal at `docs/learning-journal.md` and ask the user:

1. What did you learn? (concept, command, pattern, troubleshooting)
2. What category does it fit? (Git, TypeScript, Next.js, Troubleshooting, etc.)
3. What's the context? (what were you working on when you learned this?)

Then add a new entry to the appropriate section in `docs/learning-journal.md`:

Format:
```markdown
### [Topic Name]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Context:** Brief context about what prompted this learning

**What I learned:**
[Clear explanation of the concept/pattern/solution]

**Example/Code:**
```[language]
[Code example if applicable]
```

**Why it matters:** [Practical impact or use case]
```

If a section doesn't exist for this topic, create it following the existing format.

Update "Last Updated" date at the top of the journal.

Be clear and concise. Include code examples when helpful. Explain both "what" and "why."
