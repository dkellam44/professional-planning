## Best Overall Inspiration

### O.school Website
**Asset:** `/content/drafts/visuals/screencapture-o-school-2025-10-14-19_21_17.png`
**URL:** https://www.o.school/

**Initial notes from inspiration doc:**
- Clean and modern
- Conveys a lot of text information
- Similar purple theme with nice accented bold elements
- Good blend for our design to elaborate
- Type is above average

**Detailed analysis:**

**Color & Visual Identity:**
- **Primary purple**: Deep, vibrant purple (#5B1B8D or similar) - more saturated than current plum
- **Accent lavender/pink**: Light purple backgrounds for sections
- **High contrast**: White text on deep purple, purple on white, creates strong visual hierarchy
- **Warm imagery**: Sunset/golden hour photography paired with cool purples
- **Clean whites**: Pure white section backgrounds

**Typography:**
- **Bold, large headlines**: Hero section uses very large, bold sans-serif type (possibly 7xl-9xl equivalent)
- **Clear hierarchy**: Multiple text sizes - huge headlines, medium subheads, readable body
- **Sans-serif throughout**: Clean, modern (looks like geometric sans like Poppins, Inter, or DM Sans)
- **High contrast text**: Strong black or white against backgrounds
- **Varied weights**: Mix of bold, semibold, and regular for hierarchy

**Layout Patterns:**
1. **Hero section**: Full-width image on right, bold headline on left (deep purple background)
2. **Card grid**: Clean white cards with icons, titles, descriptions - generous padding
3. **Feature sections**: Alternating purple/white backgrounds with illustrations
4. **Content blocks**: Generous white space, clear sections, breathing room
5. **Icons throughout**: Simple, playful illustrations in purple/pink/teal

**What Makes This Work:**
- **Handles lots of text**: Multiple content sections without feeling cramped
- **Visual breathing room**: White space between sections, clean cards
- **Bold moments**: Deep purple sections create impact points
- **Playful but professional**: Illustrations add personality without being childish
- **Accessible**: High contrast ratios, clear text hierarchy
- **Modern aesthetic**: Current design trends, not dated

**Design elements to extract:**
- Use primary color (plum) more boldly - full-section backgrounds, not just accents
- Add alternating section backgrounds (cream → plum → cream rhythm)
- Higher contrast between text and backgrounds
- Consider slightly more saturated purple for impact moments
- Significantly larger headlines (h1 could go from 4xl to 6xl-9xl)
- More dramatic size variation between h1/h2/body
- Card-based sections with white backgrounds on colored fields
- Full-width colored sections to create rhythm
- Icons/simple graphics to break up text-heavy slides

**Application to KD project:**
1. **Title Slide**: Split layout (image right, bold text on plum background left) similar to their hero
2. **Help Slide**: Card grid like their course offerings section
3. **Engagement Slide**: Already has cards, but add more depth/shadow like theirs
4. **Overall**: Alternate slide backgrounds (plum sections vs cream sections) for visual rhythm
5. **Typography**: Test all-sans approach (might be cleaner/more modern than serif headings)

## Good Layouts and Contrast

### Figma Marketing Presentation Template
**Asset:** `/content/drafts/visuals/Presentation-deck-marketing.pdf`

**Initial notes from inspiration doc:**
- Great contrast
- Layouts somewhat similar to our current v4.2 build
- Excellent type (though a bit cold for KD)

**Detailed analysis:**

**Color Palette:**
- **Navy blue** (#1F2937 or similar) - Deep, professional, used for major backgrounds
- **Neon green** (#84FF00 or similar) - Electric, high-contrast accent color
- **Black** (#000000) - Ultra-high contrast sections
- **White/Light gray** - Clean backgrounds for content sections
- **Strategic contrast**: Alternating dark/light backgrounds create strong rhythm

**Typography Hierarchy:**
- **HUGE headlines**: Massively sized (possibly 80-120pt equivalent, 8xl-10xl in Tailwind)
- **Dramatic scale variation**: h1 might be 5-6x the size of body text
- **Clean sans-serif**: Modern geometric sans (looks like Inter, Poppins, or similar)
- **Weight variation**: Mix of regular and bold for hierarchy
- **Text on backgrounds**: High contrast - white on dark, black on light, green on dark
- **All-caps for emphasis**: Used sparingly for major headlines

**Layout Patterns:**
1. **Title slide (Page 1)**: Split 40/60 - image left, neon text right on navy
2. **About Us (Page 2)**: Asymmetric - large text left, image mosaic right with colored accent cards
3. **Executive Summary (Page 3)**: Overlapping image cards with prominent text, pill-shaped tags
4. **Services cards (Page 4)**: Three vertical cards on black background - green/navy/white variations
5. **Charts (Page 6)**: Full navy background with contained chart in rounded card
6. **Stats (Page 14)**: Light background with bright green stat cards, very bold
7. **Contact (Page 15)**: Navy + black split with social icons in neon green circles
8. **Numbered lists (Page 7)**: Large neon numbers with clean text, wide-format image banner

**What Makes This Work:**
- **Maximum contrast**: Black/white/navy + neon green = impossible to ignore
- **Alternating backgrounds**: Prevents monotony, creates visual rhythm
- **Card-based containment**: Content in rounded rectangles keeps it organized
- **Bold type at massive scale**: Headlines are STATEMENTS, not suggestions
- **Strategic use of neon accent**: Only for emphasis - headlines, accents, CTAs, numbers
- **Generous padding**: Cards and sections have breathing room
- **Rounded corners**: Everything has soft corners (modern, approachable)
- **Overlapping elements**: Creates depth and visual interest

**Comparison to Current Build:**
- **Similarities**: Card-based layouts, alternating section backgrounds, clean typography
- **Differences**:
  - Much bolder contrast (current build is softer/more muted)
  - Larger type sizes (current headlines could be 2-3x bigger)
  - Darker backgrounds (navy vs cream)
  - More aggressive accent color (neon green vs soft gold)
  - More dramatic visual rhythm

**Design elements to extract:**
- Consider a **darker plum** background option (closer to navy depth)
- Test a **brighter gold** for neon-like contrast against dark backgrounds
- Add **full black sections** for maximum drama
- Alternate: cream → dark plum → black → cream
- **Increase h1 size dramatically** (from 4xl to 6xl-8xl)
- **More weight variation** (thin headlines vs bold body, or vice versa)
- Test **all-caps for select headlines**
- **Smaller body text** to create more contrast with headlines
- **Rounded corners on everything** (cards, images, buttons)
- **Generous padding** in cards
- **Overlapping elements** (like Page 3 - images overlap text areas)
- **Number emphasis** (huge numerals for stats/pricing)

**Application to KD project:**

1. **Title Slide Options**:
   - Option A: Full-width KD image with bold text overlay (white text on dark gradient)
   - Option B: Split 40/60 like Page 1 (KD left, bold text on plum right)

2. **Help Slide (Services equivalent)**:
   - Three vertical cards like Page 4
   - Vary backgrounds: gold/plum/black or cream/plum/charcoal
   - Icons or illustrations at top of each card

3. **Regenerative (Metrics)**:
   - Full dark background (plum or charcoal)
   - Chart/visual in contained rounded card
   - Bright accent color for chart elements

4. **Engagement Slide (Pricing)**:
   - Light background with bold accent cards
   - Add shadows/depth like their stat cards
   - Neon-like accent (bright gold) on featured tier

5. **Overall Rhythm**:
   - Title: DARK
   - Alignment: LIGHT
   - Help: DARK
   - Regenerative: DARK
   - Fit: LIGHT
   - Engagement: LIGHT
   - CTA: DARK (dramatic ending)

**What to Adapt (Not Copy Directly):**
- **Tone**: This is corporate/energetic. KD needs warm/spiritual/professional
- **Color energy**: Neon green is too harsh. Use gold/lavender more thoughtfully
- **Typography warmth**: Maybe keep serif for headlines to maintain warmth vs cold sans
- **Illustrations**: Skip corporate icons, use organic shapes/photography

- **Script/elegant font for quotes** - more distinctive
- **Circular portraits** for warmth and approachability
- **Gradient overlays on images** for text readability
- **Gold button styling** with clear contrast
- **Section rhythm**: Cream → white → black → cream

**Application to KD project:**

1. **Title Slide**:
   - Large hero image (like their top sections)
   - Dark gradient overlay for text
   - Huge serif headline in white
   - Clean, simple, impactful

2. **Alignment Slide**:
   - Cream background
   - Text left, circular image right (or vice versa)
   - Quote in elegant script/serif
   - Generous spacing

3. **Fit Slide**:
   - Similar to their "About Layla" sections
   - Circular portrait prominent (David's headshot)
   - Bullets in clean, readable format
   - Testimonial in special callout (maybe circular image + quote)

4. **CTA Slide**:
   - **Black background** (like their dark sections)
   - Gold/warm accent buttons
   - White text for high contrast
   - More dramatic, memorable ending

**Specific Techniques:**
- **Circular crop for portraits**: Warmer, more personal than rectangles
- **Gradient overlays on images**: Dark at bottom for text readability
- **Gold button styling**:
  - Background: warm gold (#D4B483 or richer)
  - Hover state: slightly darker
  - Clear contrast against backgrounds
- **Section rhythm**: Light → dark → light creates visual variety
- **Testimonial styling**: Special treatment with possible circular image + quote
- **Mix of image sizes**: Large hero, medium cards, small portraits for variety

**What This Adds That Others Didn't:**
- **Domain-appropriate warmth**: Corporate examples were cool, this is intimate/warm
- **Circular image pattern**: Softer, more personal approach
- **Appropriate sophistication**: Balances authority with approachability for sensitive topics
- **Proof of concept**: Shows spiritual/intimate topics can be professionally designed

**Synthesis: Best of Figma + Layla:**

## Title Card Inspiration

### Stage Speaker Hero
**Asset:** `/content/drafts/visuals/Screenshot-speaker-stage-text-overlay.png`

**Initial notes from inspiration doc:**
- Stock photo: speaker onstage, full-width landscape
- Title and subtitle text overlay
- Speaker on right facing left
- KD positioned on left facing right (opposite)
- May want more elements than just fullscreen image (to test)

**Detailed analysis:**

**Layout & Composition:**
- **Full-width landscape**: Cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio
- **Speaker positioned right**: Facing left into the frame (creates directional flow)
- **Dark gradient overlay**: Left side darkened significantly for text contrast
- **Text overlay left-aligned**: White text on dark gradient area
- **Stage lighting**: Warm spotlight creates professional, energetic atmosphere
- **Depth and context**: Audience visible in background, adds scale and authority

**Typography on Image:**
- **Large bold headline**: High contrast white text, very readable
- **Smaller body text**: Still readable but clearly subordinate to headline
- **Left-aligned**: Creates visual balance with speaker on right
- **Sans-serif**: Clean, modern, professional (appropriate for corporate context)

**Gradient Overlay Technique:**
- Left third of image has dark gradient (probably 70-80% opacity black)
- Ensures text is readable regardless of image complexity
- Subtle fade from dark → transparent maintains image integrity
- Professional technique for hero images with text

**What This Shows for KD Title Slide:**
- **Directional balance**: KD faces right, so text should go left (opposite of this example) - or flip the logic
- **Gradient overlay essential**: Makes text readable over complex images without blocking subject
- **Professional context**: Stage/audience positioning = authority and credibility
- **Warm lighting**: Creates inviting, energetic atmosphere
- **Full-bleed impact**: Large hero images command attention

**Design elements to extract:**
- Dark gradient overlay technique for text readability
- Full-width hero image approach
- Clear visual balance (subject one side, text other side)
- Professional but warm lighting in photography
- Cinematic aspect ratios (16:9) for drama

**Application to KD project:**

**Title Slide Prototype A (Full-Bleed Hero):**
- Use KD hero image full-width (16:9 or 4:5 aspect)
- **Option 1**: KD positioned left facing right → text on right with dark gradient
- **Option 2**: KD positioned right facing left → text on left with dark gradient
- Text overlay: "Grounded Structure Serving Expansive Vision"
- Subtitle below in smaller size
- Contact footer at bottom
- Warm, professional photography (not stage, but similar authority)

**Key Differences from Speaker Image:**
- KD is educator/guide, not corporate keynote speaker
- Warmer, more intimate framing than conference stage
- Text should feel inviting and calm, not corporate/energetic
- Keep gradient subtle (don't make it too dark/heavy) - maintain warmth
- Consider softer serif for headline vs corporate sans

**Technical Notes:**
- Gradient should be CSS linear-gradient or overlay div with opacity
- Text must have sufficient contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- Test on mobile - gradient may need adjustment for portrait orientation
- Consider multiple image crops for different breakpoints

## Anti-Examples (What to Avoid)

### Anti-Example 1: Astral Unicorn ("ugly-spiritual.jpeg")
**Asset:** `/content/drafts/visuals/ugly-spiritual.jpeg`

**Why to avoid:**
- Lazy psychedelic aesthetics
- Metaphysical clichés
- Not aligned with KD's sophisticated, modern approach

**Analysis:**

**Visual Issues:**
- **Overly saturated psychedelic colors**: Neon pink/purple/blue space explosion background
- **Cliché imagery**: Astral unicorn, cosmic explosions, mystical glyphs/symbols
- **Too busy**: Multiple competing visual elements (unicorn, planets, nebulas, lightning, sacred geometry)
- **Hard to read**: Text fights with busy, high-contrast background
- **Childish execution**: Looks like fantasy novel cover or festival poster, not professional service
- **Stock imagery abuse**: Obvious composited stock elements poorly integrated

**Typography Problems:**
- **Neon pink script font**: Hard to read, feels juvenile and unprofessional
- **Poor contrast**: Pink on purple/space background = readability nightmare
- **Too many fonts**: Multiple styles compete, no clear hierarchy
- **Decorative over functional**: Font choice prioritizes "mystical" over communication

**Tone Issues:**
- **"Woo-woo" overload**: Every new-age cliché simultaneously (unicorns + cosmos + energy + mysticism)
- **Not grounded**: Feels escapist and fantasy-focused, not practical/helpful
- **Lacks sophistication**: Appeals to fantasy, not discerning adults seeking real guidance
- **Undermines credibility**: Looks amateur, not like professional expert
- **Cheap and garish**: Feels like quick Canva template, not thoughtful design

**Specific elements to avoid:**
- ❌ Psychedelic color palettes (neon purples, hot pinks, electric blues)
- ❌ Mystical clichés (third eyes, chakras, cosmic explosions, unicorns, sacred geometry overload)
- ❌ Space/galaxy backgrounds
- ❌ Overly ornate/mystical decorative fonts
- ❌ Too many visual elements competing for attention
- ❌ Neon gradients and glow effects
- ❌ Low contrast text on busy backgrounds
- ❌ Stock imagery composites that look cheap/fake

**Why This Fails for KD:**
- KD's work is grounded, intelligent, trauma-informed - not fantasy/escapism
- Target audience is sophisticated adults, not people seeking spiritual bypassing
- This aesthetic signals "unserious" rather than "expert guide"
- Contradicts the "grounded structure" positioning

---

### Anti-Example 2: Third Eye Coaching ("ugly-third-eye.jpeg")
**Asset:** `/content/drafts/visuals/ugly-third-eye.jpeg`

**Analysis:**

**Visual Issues:**
- **Soft-focus cloudy background**: Looks cheap, dated (circa 2008-2012 spiritual blog)
- **Third eye chakra graphic**: Overused spiritual cliché, on-the-nose symbolism
- **Pastel purple/blue clouds**: Washed out, lacks depth and contrast
- **Generic mystical symbol**: Crescent moon, meditation pose, chakra point - all predictable
- **Poor photography/stock image quality**: Low resolution, soft, blurry
- **Amateurish composition**: Centered, static, no visual interest

**Typography Problems:**
- **Script font for name**: Hard to read, feels pretentious
- **Too decorative**: Sacrifices readability for "spiritual" aesthetic
- **Weak contrast**: Light text on light background reduces readability
- **Generic "spiritual" font**: Overly feminine script that's been overused
- **No hierarchy**: Welcome text and other elements compete

**Tone Issues:**
- **Overly mystical**: Third eye symbolism is too literal and cliché
- **Dated aesthetic**: Looks 10-15 years old, not current
- **Not professional**: Feels hobby-level personal blog, not expert service
- **Vague and ethereal**: Doesn't communicate specific value or expertise
- **Escapist rather than grounded**: All clouds and chakras, no substance
- **Lacks authority**: Soft, vague aesthetic doesn't build trust

**Specific elements to avoid:**
- ❌ Literal chakra/third eye imagery
- ❌ Cloudy/soft-focus mystical backgrounds
- ❌ Overly decorative script fonts that sacrifice readability
- ❌ Pastel purple/pink washed-out palettes
- ❌ Generic meditation pose graphics/silhouettes
- ❌ Cheap stock photos with spiritual overlays
- ❌ Mystical symbols as primary branding
- ❌ Soft, unfocused imagery
- ❌ Centered, static compositions with no visual interest

**Why This Fails for KD:**
- Too soft and vague - KD offers concrete operational support
- Dated aesthetic undermines modern, professional positioning
- Third eye symbolism is too literal and overused in spiritual communities
- Doesn't differentiate from thousands of wellness coaches
- Lacks the sophistication KD's audience expects

### Anti-Example 3: Bad PowerPoint ("ugly-ppt.jpeg")
**Asset:** `/content/drafts/visuals/ugly-ppt.jpeg`

**Analysis:**

**Layout Issues:**
- **Text everywhere**: Wall of text with no visual hierarchy or breathing room
- **Poor contrast**: Hard to read text directly on busy photo background
- **Competing elements**: Photo, title, body text, logo all fight each other
- **No breathing room**: Cramped, overwhelming, claustrophobic
- **Mismatched elements**: Clip-art tree, photo background, text boxes don't visually relate
- **Amateur composition**: Elements placed randomly without design system

**Typography Problems:**
- **All caps headline in decorative font**: Aggressive and hard to read
- **Too much text**: Full paragraph of body copy on what should be a title slide
- **Poor text wrapping**: Awkward line breaks, uneven spacing
- **Multiple text colors**: Pink, white, yellow text creates chaos
- **No hierarchy**: Everything fights for attention, nothing stands out
- **Unreadable font choices**: Decorative fonts for body text

**Design Problems:**
- **Clip-art graphics**: Unprofessional, dated (early 2000s aesthetic)
- **Busy photo background**: Makes text unreadable, competes with content
- **Poor color choices**: Pink + purple + green + yellow = visual chaos
- **Amateur execution**: Looks like someone's first PowerPoint without design knowledge
- **No design system**: Random choices, no consistent theme
- **Border/frame conflicts**: Multiple border styles compete

**What Makes This Fail:**
- **Tries to say everything at once**: No focus or clear message
- **Neglects readability**: Can't even read the content
- **Visual clutter**: Every element competes, eyes don't know where to look
- **No professional polish**: Feels rushed, careless, low-effort
- **Contradictory messaging**: Claims professionalism while demonstrating lack of it

**Specific elements to avoid:**
- ❌ Walls of text on slides (especially title slides)
- ❌ Text directly on busy photo backgrounds without proper overlays/contrast treatment
- ❌ Clip-art or low-quality graphics
- ❌ All-caps headlines (except very sparingly for specific emphasis)
- ❌ Multiple competing text colors (stick to 2-3 max)
- ❌ Cramped layouts with no white space
- ❌ Trying to fit too much content on one slide
- ❌ Poor hierarchy where everything has same visual weight
- ❌ Decorative borders and frames (keep it clean)
- ❌ Mismatched visual elements (random clip-art + photos)

**Why This Fails Generally:**
- Demonstrates lack of design literacy
- Undermines credibility and professionalism
- Makes content inaccessible due to poor readability
- Creates cognitive overload for viewer
- Feels outdated and low-effort

---

## Synthesis & Design Direction

### Color Palette Refinements

**Recommended Palette:**

**Base Colors:**
- **Cream** (#FAF8F3) - Primary background, warm and spacious
- **White** (#FFFFFF) - Alternate section backgrounds, pure and clean
- **Charcoal** (#2B2B2B) - Primary text color, soft black

**Accent Colors:**
- **Deep Plum** (#6B1F5C or #5B2149) - Richer, more saturated than current, for full section backgrounds
- **Warm Gold** (#C9A961 or #D4AF66) - More prominent than current, for CTAs and emphasis
- **Lavender** (#D8A7C4) - Subtle, for light backgrounds and gentle accents
- **Sage** (#9BA88C) - Keep for regenerative/nature elements

**High Contrast:**
- **Pure Black** (#000000) - For dramatic sections (CTA slide, possibly one other)
- **Pure White text** - On all dark backgrounds

**Usage Guidelines:**
- **Backgrounds**: Alternate cream → white → plum → black → cream
- **Text**: Charcoal on light, white on dark
- **CTAs**: Gold backgrounds or borders, high visibility
- **Accents**: Plum for headers on light backgrounds, gold for emphasis

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Neon or overly saturated colors
- ❌ Pastel washed-out versions
- ❌ More than 5-6 colors total
- ❌ Random color usage without system

### Typography Decisions

**Recommended System:**

**Headings:**
- **H1**: 7xl-9xl, Playfair Display (serif), bold, dramatic size
- **H2**: 4xl-5xl, Playfair Display, semibold
- **H3**: 2xl-3xl, Inter (sans), semibold

**Body & UI:**
- **Body**: base-lg (18px), Inter, regular, generous line-height (1.7-1.8)
- **Small/Caption**: sm (14px), Inter, regular
- **Buttons**: base, Inter, semibold, all-caps or sentence case

**Special:**
- **Quotes**: 2xl-3xl, Crimson Text (serif), italic, distinctive treatment
- **Numbers/Stats**: 6xl-8xl, Inter, bold, for emphasis

**Hierarchy Principle:**
- H1 should be 6-8x the size of body text (dramatic contrast)
- Each heading level should be a clear visual step down
- Generous spacing between elements

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Overly decorative script fonts for headings
- ❌ Too many font families (stick to 3 max)
- ❌ Poor contrast (maintain readability)
- ❌ All-caps for long passages
- ❌ Tiny text (nothing smaller than 14px)

### Layout Patterns

**Recommended Patterns:**

**1. Full-Bleed Hero (Title Slide)**
- Full-width image, dark gradient overlay
- Text on gradient side, huge serif headline
- Cinematic and impactful

**2. Split Content (Alignment, Fit)**
- 60/40 or 70/30 split
- Text one side, image (circular or rectangular) other side
- Generous spacing, breathing room

**3. Card Grid (Help, Engagement)**
- 3 vertical or horizontal cards
- White/cream cards on colored backgrounds OR
- Colored cards on light backgrounds
- Rounded corners, generous padding, shadows for depth

**4. Full Background with Contained Content (Regenerative)**
- Full section background color
- Content in centered container or rounded card
- Visual element (chart, graphic) prominent

**5. Dramatic Dark (CTA)**
- Full black or deep plum background
- White text, gold buttons
- High contrast, memorable ending

**Common Elements:**
- Rounded corners (8-16px) on all cards, images, buttons
- Generous padding (p-8 to p-12)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Breathing room between elements

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Cramped layouts
- ❌ Too many elements competing
- ❌ Sharp corners (use rounded everywhere)
- ❌ Inconsistent spacing
- ❌ Walls of text

### Contrast & Visual Hierarchy

**Contrast Principles:**
- **WCAG AA minimum**: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Dramatic size jumps**: Headlines vs body should be very different
- **Background alternation**: Light → dark → light creates rhythm
- **Visual weight**: Bold, large elements draw eye first

**Hierarchy Techniques:**
- **Size**: Largest = most important
- **Weight**: Bold = emphasis
- **Color**: Accent colors = focus
- **Spacing**: More space = more important
- **Position**: Top/center = primary

**Specific Applications:**
1. **Title Slide**: Huge headline (8xl-9xl), dramatic image, clear CTA
2. **Content Slides**: Large h1 (6xl-7xl), readable body (base-lg), clear sections
3. **CTA Slide**: Gold buttons impossible to miss, white text pops on black

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Everything same size/weight
- ❌ Low contrast text (light gray on white)
- ❌ Competing focal points
- ❌ Insufficient spacing between elements

- **Background**: Split (image | plum)
- **Vibe**: Modern, bold, balanced

**Prototype C: Contained Hero**
- **Image**: KD hero in rounded rectangle, not full-bleed
- **Layout**: Cream background, centered or asymmetric image placement
- **KD Position**: Large but contained
- **Text**: Overlapping or adjacent to image
  - H1: Could be on image with overlay OR beside image on cream
  - More spacious, gallery-like feel
- **Background**: Cream with potential plum accent elements
- **Vibe**: Spacious, gallery, sophisticated

**Decision Criteria:**
- Which feels most "KD"?
- Which best serves the warm + grounded + professional positioning?
- Mobile responsiveness
- First impression impact

### Priority 2: Typography System

**Goal**: Lock in exact font sizes, weights, and usage

**Tasks:**
1. **Test headline sizes**: Build slides with 6xl, 7xl, 8xl, 9xl headlines - see what feels right
2. **Verify body size**: Ensure base-lg (18px) is readable and spacious
3. **Quote styling**: Design special treatment for KD quotes (background? border? size?)
4. **Button styling**: Gold button with proper hover states
5. **Responsive scaling**: Ensure mobile sizes step down appropriately

**Specific Decisions Needed:**
- H1: 7xl, 8xl, or 9xl?
- Serif or sans for H1? (leaning serif for warmth)
- Quote treatment: Lavender background? Gold left border? Just italic + large?
- All-caps for any headings? (probably not, except maybe H3/labels)

### Priority 3: Color/Contrast Enhancements

**Goal**: Apply bold color strategy throughout

**Tasks:**
1. **Background rhythm**: Decide which slides get cream, white, plum, black
2. **Test dark plum**: Ensure it's bold enough without being harsh
3. **Gold CTA buttons**: Make them impossible to miss
4. **Card shadows/depth**: Add subtle shadows to cards for dimension
5. **Accent usage**: Where does lavender/sage appear?

**Slide-by-Slide Color Plan:**
- **Title**: Full-bleed image with gradient OR plum background
- **Alignment**: Cream or white (light, spacious)
- **Help**: Dark plum or charcoal (dramatic cards)
- **Regenerative**: Cream/white with plum accent elements
- **Fit**: White (clean, professional)
- **Engagement**: Cream with white cards OR white with colored accents
- **CTA**: Pure black (dramatic, memorable)

**Testing:**
- Run contrast checker on all text/background combinations
- Preview in browser light/dark mode
- Test on mobile screens
