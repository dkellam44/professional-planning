Visual Inspiration


**Best Overall Inspiration**
**O.school Website** : '/visuals/screencapture-o-school-2025-10-14-19_21_17.png'

This is a screenshot of the O.school website [O.school](https://www.o.school/) a sex education and ecommerce website. This is clean and modern, conveys a lot of text information and has a similar purple theme with nice accented bold elements. This is a good blend for our design and to to elaborate. This type is above average.

**Good layouts and contrast**

This is the Figma marketing presentation template: '/visuals/Presentation-deck-marketing.pdf' 

This is a figma presentation that has great contrast and some layouts that are somewhat similar to what we've generated in the build so far (up to v4.2). I think the  type is excellent if a little bit cold for KD's presentation

**Domain Expert Website**

This is the website of [Layla Martin](https://laylamartin.com/) one of the bigest sex coaches and influencers in North America. This is a good visual language of a best in class personal brand in the same field as KD. I like the variation in font sizes, energetic images balanced with calm text presentation

**Title Card Inspiration**

Stage Speaker Hero:'/visuals/Screenshot-speaker-stage-text-overlay.png'

Here is a stock photo of a speaker onstage in a full width landscape composition with Title and subtile text overlay. This is inspiration for our title card. though I may want to have more elements than just the fullscreen image. Something to Test. This speaker is on the right facing left. KD is positioned on the left facing right.
