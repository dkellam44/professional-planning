# Venture Brief — Reference Venture (Example)

## Positioning
We help solo operators stand up **portable, AI-ready context systems** that compound learning and execution across tools (Chat + Claude Code), without vendor lock-in.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Status: solo/owner-operator or small team (<10)
- Needs: faster planning cycles, consistent outputs, cross-tool continuity
- Constraints: privacy-sensitive; prefers files as SoT; Notion/Coda for projection
- Buying triggers: new service launch, process standardization push, AI adoption initiative

## Offer Strategy
- Core: Productized “Context Architecture Sprint” (fixed-scope, 2 weeks)
- Expansion: “Run & Improve” monthly retainer (playbook promotion, eval, automation)
- Differentiators: mode-aware retrieval, eval gate ≥ 0.80, portability-first design

## Venture-level OKRs (example)
- O1: Stand up 5 client portfolios with eval gate ≥ 0.80 by Q2.
- KR1: Average time-to-first-sprint scaffold < 1 day.
- KR2: 90% of deliverables meet acceptance tests on first review.

## Guardrails
- No secrets in prompts; zones enforced (`internal` default; elevate as needed).
- Templates preferred; placeholders allowed only when templates missing.
- Do not duplicate SoT/Prompts; always inherit via `.contextrc.yaml`.
