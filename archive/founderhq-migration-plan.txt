## POST-MIGRATION TASKS

5. **Set up automations** (Daily Thread reminders, etc.)
6. **Update documentation** to reflect "no DB prefix" convention

---

## NOTES & DECISIONS

- **ID Strategy:** Adding Unique ID + [Object] ID to all major tables
- **Naming:** Dropping "DB" prefix for cleaner UX
- **Formula Syntax:** Using Notion prop() syntax
- **Relations:** All bidirectional where applicable
- **Priority:** Focus on 80/20 - core tables that drive daily operations

---

## ROLLBACK PLAN

If issues occur:
1. Database schemas can be reverted using Notion version history
2. Relations can be removed without data loss
3. Old text fields kept during migration (delete after verification)
4. Export CSV backups before major changes
