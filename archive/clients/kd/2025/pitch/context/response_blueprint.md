## Short Email Template
Hi Kali Das,

Thank you for sharing KD’s post — their vision really resonates with me.  
I’ve worked in digital operations for creative and nonprofit teams and also have long-standing roots in the tantra and sex-positive communities. I specialize in creating calm, dependable systems — from calendar and inbox flow to publishing rhythms and gentle automation.

If it’s helpful, I can outline a short two-week trial focused on immediate relief — simplifying the calendar, clarifying priorities, and establishing a single source of truth for projects and content.

**Availability:** 10–15 hrs/week (1:00 PM or 4:00 PM PT meetings).  
**Compensation range:** $40–$45/hr (open to scope).  

Would a short call this week to explore fit work for you?

Warm regards,  
**David Kellam**
