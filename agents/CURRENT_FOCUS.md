# Current Focus — 2025-10-28

**THIS FILE = START HERE for every new agent session**

**Read this first. Takes 5 minutes. Tells you everything you need to know.**

---

## Right Now: Three Priorities

1. **Define First Service Offer** (HIGH)
   - Location: `/ventures/ops-studio/offers/`
   - Status: Not yet created
   - Why: Can't sell without clear offer definition
   - Next: Research market, create offer brief

2. **Build Prospect Pipeline** (HIGH)
   - Location: `/ventures/ops-studio/pipeline/outreach_tracker.md`
   - Status: Zero active prospects
   - Why: Need pipeline to get first client
   - Next: Identify 5-10 targets, draft outreach

3. **Operational Stability** (MEDIUM)
   - Daily workflow: `/ventures/ops-studio/DAILY_WORKFLOW.md`
   - Infrastructure: Working (n8n ✅ Coda MCP ✅)
   - Next: Use daily workflow, refine based on experience

---

## Business Reality

- **Stage:** Pre-revenue (zero clients)
- **Focus:** Offers → Outreach → First Client
- **Tools:** Coda (deal tracking), GitHub (specs), n8n (automation)
- **Timeline:** Q4/Q1 for first paying engagement

---

## Latest Session Handoff

📍 `/agents/context/sessions/SESSION_HANDOFF_2025-10-28_v1.md`

**Summary:** Infrastructure stabilized. KD engagement closed (learning reference). Repo reorganization complete.

---

## Infrastructure Status

🟢 **GREEN** — All systems working
- n8n: https://n8n.bestviable.com (✅ 200)
- Coda MCP: https://coda.bestviable.com/sse (✅ 200)
- Last verified: 2025-10-28
- Confidence: Working but needs operational use

---

## What NOT to Work On (Deferred)

- ❌ Authority Map JSON validation
- ❌ Automated n8n sync workflows
- ❌ SoT meta-architecture
- ❌ Evaluation harness

**These are valuable but come AFTER first client.**

## Decision: What Should I Work On?

```
Do you have active billable work?
├─ YES → Do that (client work first)
└─ NO → Check CURRENT_FOCUS priorities
    ├─ Need offer spec? → Work on offer
    ├─ Need prospects? → Build pipeline
    └─ Neither? → Refine delivery process or learning
```

## Remember

- **Client work > Infrastructure > Meta work**
- **Done > Perfect**
- **Commit often > Perfect commits rarely**
- **When confused → Read this file again**
