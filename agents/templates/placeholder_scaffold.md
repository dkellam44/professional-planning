# Placeholder Scaffold — How to structure empty files

<!-- PURPOSE: Use this scaffold when creating thin placeholders so agents have consistent metadata and humans know what to fill. -->

**Copy this top metadata block verbatim and adjust values.**

```
- entity: <entity_name>
- level: <level_name>          # e.g., identity | policy | brief | roadmap | spec | playbook
- zone: internal               # public | internal | private | restricted
- version: v01
- tags: [tag1, tag2]
- source_path: <repo-relative-path>   # e.g., /ventures/foo/projects/bar/context/planning_brief_v01.md
- date: YYYY-MM-DD
```
