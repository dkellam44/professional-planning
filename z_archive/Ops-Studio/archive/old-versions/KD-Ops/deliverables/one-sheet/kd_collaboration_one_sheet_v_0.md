*(Prepared by David Kellam — October 2025)*

## 1. Alignment & Intent
KamalaDevi’s work integrates spirituality, sexuality, and creative leadership. My intent is to bring **calm, dependable structure** that expands KD’s creative freedom and reduces operational strain.

I approach this opportunity as both an **assistant** and a **strategic partner** — blending compassionate collaboration with systems thinking honed through years in nonprofit, arts, and conscious-business settings.

> **Purpose:** Create operational spaciousness so KD can focus on service, art, and writing — with confidence that the details are cared for.
