# Intermediary Relationship Strategy — Collaborating with Kali Das
*Generated: 2025-10-08*

Kali Das (Executive Assistant) may function as intermediary and ongoing collaborator. The goal is to **make their job easier** while aligning tightly with KD’s creative priorities.

## Principles
- **Two-Audience Alignment:** Communicate in a way that serves KD’s vision *and* Kali Das’ operational needs.
- **Signal Reliability:** Clear responses, structured info, and on-time follow-through.
- **Respectful Autonomy:** Propose decisions you can own; escalate gracefully when required.

## Immediate Tactics
1. **Mirror the Ask in One Pass:** When replying, include the three items Kali Das requested — relevant experience, requested compensation, and weekly availability — in a clean bullet list.
2. **Offer Scheduling Options Within Windows:** Provide 2–3 time slots matching Pacific windows — *1:00 PM, 2:30 PM, 4:00 PM, 5:30 PM PT*.
3. **Single Source of Truth (SST):** Propose a simple shared hub (Notion/Coda/Drive folder) for agendas, decisions, and pending items to reduce back-and-forth.
4. **Template the Common Flows:** Offer to draft micro-SOPs for: inbox triage, calendar rules, and launch checklists.

## Collaboration Norms
- **Cadence:** Weekly 20–30 min sync to review priorities; async updates otherwise.
- **Escalation:** Define what you can resolve (level 1) vs. what needs KD/Kali input (level 2).
- **Documentation:** Summaries after each sync with decisions, owners, and due dates.
- **Tone:** Professional-spiritual — warm, concise, and respectful. Consider closings such as *“With appreciation,”* or *“Warm regards.”*

## Example Reply Block (for Kali Das)
- **Relevant experience:** Creator-ops systems (calendar, inbox, content cadence), SOP writing, light automations; comfortable in spiritual/queer community contexts.

- **Requested compensation:** (example) $35–$45/hour or a fixed-fee trial sprint; open to discuss based on scope.

- **Availability:** (example) 10–15 hours/week; can meet at **1:00 PM or 4:00 PM PT** this week.


## Early-Win Sprint (2 Weeks)
- **Week 1:** Calendar cleanup + inbox protocol + set up SST.

- **Week 2:** Content cadence template + event/launch checklist + metrics snapshot.

**Outcomes:** Lower cognitive load, predictable rhythm, and fewer last-minute fires.
