# David Kellam — Personal Profile v0.7
### Candidate for Executive/Operations Partnership with KamalaDevi Creative  
*(Updated October 2025 — work-in-progress; areas needing elaboration marked TODO)*

---

## 1. Overview
**Professional Focus:** Designing and managing systems that make creative and spiritual work sustainable.  
**Why:** I believe the sacred work of teachers, artists, and healers flourishes when their support systems are as conscious as their message. My purpose is to build those systems — ones that breathe, adapt, and grow with the people they serve.  
**Vision Alignment:** KD’s mission of liberation through love and embodiment resonates deeply with my own journey through creativity, service, and operational mastery. This collaboration feels like a natural convergence of paths.  
**Shared Creative Roots:** As a former theater professional and writer, I share KD’s appreciation for performance as transformation and storytelling as spiritual practice.  
**Style:** Calm, collaborative, and systems-minded. Balances creative empathy with analytical rigor.  
**Current Direction:** Founder of *Operations Studio*, helping conscious leaders stabilize their operations and build scalable infrastructure.  

> “I create spaciousness through structure — letting inspired people stay in their creative zone while the details take care of themselves.”

I build operations as living ecosystems: they capture memory, invite reflection, and evolve.  
Each process becomes a feedback loop — not just executing tasks, but teaching the team how to work with more ease and awareness over time.
